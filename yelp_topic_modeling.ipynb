We walked pass the smaller dining room and went to the bar area. No staff was present as we stood around for a while... we would have just sat down at the bar but nothing was cleared off and all the tables but 2 still had plates on them. We brushed this off as we assumed they probably had a rush during lunch. The server came out and told us to choose any of the 2 tables available. We looked through the menu and I got pretty excited at the different options available. I like how their menu has pictures on them with little descriptions. I also noticed the seat covers for the chairs made out of Thai/Laotian cloth and can appreciate the time it took to make those. \n",

For us being the only people in the restaurant by now, the appetizer took about 30 minutes to come out. The taro puff was really big while the chicken puff was really small. The server told us that the chefs were making them fresh and when each were done, they both realized they were different sizes as they were having a competition on whose would taste better. I did not mind the fun they were having but I did wish that the chicken puff was at least a reasonable size to share, especially since there were only 2 and it cost $6.95. But hey, we went along with the show and the taste of the puffs were good. The crust was crispy like croissant dough and the seasoning in the chicken was balanced. The taro puff was also yummy but the taro filling tasted a bit grainy. Overall, both tasted good with the sauce which has fresh garnishing inside.\n",

            "For our entrees, I ordered the drunken noodles and my coworker ordered the pho. I will be honest and say we were both really disappointed in our dishes. I know this is a family restaurant who puts a lot of thought and pride into their food, but I did not feel like I was eating a Thai dish at all. The drunken noodles were thinner than the typical drunken noodles which are usually thick and fat. I ordered a level 4 for spiciness and the sauce was actually very sweet. I was hoping to have that burning sensation in my mouth but instead, it was just overly sweet and overly sauced. I ended up picking out the carrots, broccoli, green beans, and chicken out of the noodles to eat. I really tried to eat more but simply could not do it because of how sweet it was. The server came out to ask how the food tasted and I told him that it was sweet and not as spicy as I had hoped. He suggested that I put in the Thai chili pepper to make it spicier but at this point, I felt like it was pointless because the sweetness of the sauce had already coated my entire mouth. I ended up not packing any of it home and felt bad for wasting food but honestly could not see myself eating any more of it later.\n",

She was super excited to dive into it as all the right toppings came out on a plate: the basil, jalepeno peppers, lime, etc. There were also the sauces on the side: thai chili pepper, garlic chili pepper, pickled jalepeno, and sugar. She let me try a taste of her broth and we both were surprised that for its nice color, the flavor really lacked depth. I make pho at home and it honestly reminded me a bit of the beef pho flavor paste that I add to boiling water when I am in a pinch to make \"lazy pho.\" I am not saying that is the case here and do not want to offend the chefs because I respect the time they put into making our food... but that's what the broth really reminded me of when I tried it.

All the recommendations I've had from my Cleveland friends told me that The Greenhouse was such a place, and one that rated visiting on one of my too-rare stops in Cleveland. Yet the experience was - and this is the only word to describe it - bizarre. \n",
            "\n",
            "Their rendition of a Cleveland standard, stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, was stellar, but from there the meal descended into chaos.  Was the Greenhouse was going for the 'greenest' of cuisine, minimalist dishes where the ingredients saw as little preparation as possible, or more of a stylized, structured 'haute' cuisine? We couldn't tell, and neither really worked. The appetizer of roasted peppers with smashed garlic was an example of the former - the two main ingredients were simply treated and mixed upon the plate, the garlic somewhat in and out of its paper, which stuck to the moist pepper skin, making for a ridiculous looking plate and an unpleasant eating experience.   The 'Mushroom Bear Claw' - a cinnamon bun like roll of mushrooms in puff pastry -- arrived looking stunning amidst the rich miso broth it sat upon. While the pastry was good and the stuffing tasty, the miso was both so acidic and so salty that it ruined the dish by overpowering the delicacy of the woodear mushroom filling.  A main course of white bean polenta, Lee Jones vegetables, and tofu occupied the opposite end of the spectrum - that food had been tortured into a structured submission by the chef:  the excellent seasonal vegetables had been tourned (properly, I should note), and placed next to tofu and a perfectly square polenta cake. The highly stylized dish was an odd followup to the minimalist pepper appetizer - and why, if you are showing off the quality of your ingredients, touting Chef's Garden as a supplier, would you tourne them?  The dish might have been fine were it not for the brine that the elements sat in. My date tried to eat just the top of the excellent polenta as that which had soaked up the extremely salty broth was inedible.  My entrée, the Duck Pasta, was supposed to be duck livers and craklins, roasted red onion, and local apples with a cavatelli-like pasta and toasted bread crumbs. The pasta arrived limp and overcooked, with none of the other ingredients discernable - supposedly they must have been the spaetzele-like brown crumbs that coated the pasta. Or was that the breadcrumbs? Or were they ground into the sauce on the pasta? We had no idea.  It seemed to be another rather stylized dish that might have been just sub par were it not for - again - an incredible amount of salt that rendered it truly unpleasant.. Unlike my date's main course, this could not be salvaged by selectively eating parts. After my date agreed, we asked for the check.\n",

We also got a little bit of a funky smell on our Pancit Malabon (common to improperly stored rice noodles/sauce). Knowing what a really freshly cooked Pancit Malabon smells like, I just know that the sauce or the noodles on my order may have not been handled properly. Since I have already mentioned the Pancit Malabon, I might as well finish my review of the could have been noodle delight. The pancit flavor was very very very flat. It was very far from the layers of salty, sweet, garlicky, seafood umami flavor. I was saddened by the lack of seafood (got maybe 3-4 smal shrimps). The crunch from the pork rind was none existent. I was also looking for the smoked fish saltiness that makes Pancit Malabon a pancit from Malabon. \n",

My boyfriend and I ate here regularly, at least once a week and we always did AYCE, I did couple a la carte for lunch to go. Quality and cleanliness were over the top. Waiting up to an hour or more for dinner everytime was always worth it. The service was always so amazing. Until recently, I had a (new) server that got sassy with me one visit, didn't say anything. Went back couple more times after that and the service and food kept going down hill. Servers were not as attentive and it seems to be almost a new crew except for some that has been there awhile. One bus boy was awesome, don't know his name and the sushi chefs are cool too. Apri, the hostess is sweet. Other than those mentioned, None of the other servers have any personality. \n",

            "Last time my boyfriend and I ate here (which we almost went back for one last chance a week later but decided to go to our other favorite sushi place. More on that later) I was so disgusted by how dirty everything was and the quality of the food. The plate of wasabi and ginger had dried  up food still stuck on it (somehow, the server missed that putting wasabi and ginger on it). I scraped it off and let it go. More plates came with food, all the plates had dried up food still stuck on them. My beer glass had lip stains around the rim. I didn't say a damn thing about any of those dirty dishes. Food came, everything had smaller portions than before. All the nigiris had a tiny piece of fish on them. Amount of food from side dishes were cut in half. I get it, it's AYCE smaller the portion the more you can eat or less food you may waste. But what the restaurant started with and what people grew to love should be priority and that's the quality of the food, that went down hill. I'm so disappointed, I'd love to still go there but after all the past experiences the last few visits we won't be going back ever again. Umiya is closer and has always been our other favorite when goyemon is too busy or when we don't want to make the drive. The quality of the food is amazing. The servers actually have personality and actually acknowledge the fact that you're a regular. Way better vibe. \n",

            "|I was able to visit this hipsterish wifi café on two separate occasions after reading so much about it on Yelp. The horizontal interior has good natural lighting, a front pastry counter, arrangement of tables and high chairs to the left, and a wine bar to the right. Noise level is high, and the clientele includes laptop dwellers, students, and group gatherings.\n",

            "Kale and Roasted Beets Salad ($9): A good serving of fresh kale, walnuts, goat cheese, roasted beets and red pepper vinaigrette. The composition was tasty, as the mix of creamy goat cheese, crunchy walnuts, fresh beets, and firm beets were delightful. I had this salad on both visits. Quality can be inconsistent between visits, as the kale was slightly yellow on the first try and overdressed and saltier yesterday. I'm likely to try the Quinoa Salad before coming back to order this dish again.\n",

            "Pear and Arugula Melt ($9): Flat bread layered with fresh pears, arugula, fontina cheese, and dressed with balsamic raspberry reduction. This item is no longer available on the menu, but the inconsistent firm and softness in the flat bread struggled, and the sour balsamic raspberry reduction didn't mix well with the pear. The café will jumpstart a new menu soon, so hopefully the flatbread will be much improved if it's scheduled for a return.\n",

            "Soy Dirty Chai Latte ($6.34): The latte was sweet with a solid hint of strong espresso and noticeable chai. The price was steep because they penalize diners for the use of soy--even though there is not a whole lot of differentiation to the cost of milk in the supermarket. This was one of the better dirty chai lattes, but also not worth the price.\n",

It reminded me of flatbread, cheese and tomato sauce baked on an ever so thin crust. I felt like I could have made the pizza myself and it would have turned out better. Some of it was also burnt. All the courses had the same flavour theme of cheese, tomato and salad and while one may like the compliments in taste, I did not. All the courses tasted similar. Therefore, the bread was what stood out which is weird considering that it was not the main. The espresso cinnamon gelato was so decant and yummy. One scoop was too little. It was the right hint of espresso. If you ever visit here, this is your best bet for dessert. \n",

            "|The first time we tried Lucky's was maybe six years ago. I didn't like it then. Hard to remember what we ordered, perhaps a Sicilian style, but either the crust or sauce or something else turned us off and we decided not to go back. Until a couple of weeks ago, when, having exhausted just about every other food place in Surprise two dozens times over, I came up with the jolly idea of getting us some Lucky's again based on all the good reviews. And I hated it just as much this time around as the first. UGH.\n",

Imagine a large pizza box precisely filled with a giant square BRICK of a pizza, easily an inch and a half tall and cut into square slices. That's what we got. I'd say it was over 3 pounds of pizza; flavorless and gross. I found it breathtaking that it had that little taste. This was a supreme pizza that tasted through and through like I was eating play-doh. Olives, sauce, cheese, crust, the works. To top it off, the mushrooms were slimy, canned champignons and not fresh at all, and tasted as though they'd just been pulled out of someone's nose. I've had some pretty bad pizza in my time, most of them I'd liken to eating chewy, dry cardboard. This was the first one that was this big and relatively succulent and STILL tasted gross.\n",

            "I stomached maybe six slices over two sorry-ass sittings before throwing about 2/3 of the pizza away. Two pounds' worth of \"food\", down the sh1tter. I don't know where the mass delusion about this place comes from, but I'll never return. If I want a gutbuster special, especially now that Bronco Billy's is gone, I'll head to Rays just down the road instead. Plus, Lucky's is overpriced. A large and a smaller pizza cost us $30. Most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too - I didn't try any of that one so I'm not reviewing it, but the wife said she was incredibly unimpressed with it, and it was just a plain cheese. If it all tasted good it would have been worth it - I'd have paid that and more for a Chuck Wagon Special from Billy's - but the lack of flavour and value drops my rating of this joint to a bottom-of-the-barrel single star.

Being jewish and from the east coast I hold \"new york\" deli's to a higher standard and judge them on corned beef/pastrami, potato salad, rye bread and pickles. You get those right you have a happy camper, wrong and i'm cranky.

The meats were a bit overcooked but nice and hot and had decent flavored and the pastrami had a good amount of pepper to it (which i like). However it was very greasy and soaked the bread and made it slick...not good. The bread itself wasn't bad just generic rye you would buy on the shelf at any grocery. There also wasn't enough mustard on it or much meat probably double the bread to meat on a $9 sandwich. Compared to Chompies where its a nice thin slice of rye and piles of meat.

In the backyard there's service at the bar and you can only order salad, pizza, and desert, which was fine with us. In the process of ordering at the bar some dude stole our table who's drunk middle-aged pal later got in our faces for no good reason.

            "|My \"foodie friend\" insisted I try this place and has been talking about it for a very long time! We went today. I had to park in the back which is surrounded by an unsavory residential area. So parking was my first concern. The restaurant inside was quaint and nice. For such a highly acclaimed restaurant, I wasn't at all impressed with the service. I was not greeted. Since I was meeting my friend, I decided to just look around myself. I understand that this is not an On The Border or \"traditional\" Mexican food as soon as I open the menu. Unfortunately, that's the kind of Mexican food that I like! No chips and salsa. Isn't that a staple at any Mexican restaurant? They served bread, which wasn't even good. Very basic bread like what you could purchase at Basha's and some type of chili/tomatoe spread. I skipped that. We ordered guacamole which was awesome. Too bad the chips they served were so dry and bland. Again, in my opinion the guacamole would have been so much better on the thin salty chips that I am used to! I was starving so I decided to get adventurous and order something that sounded somewhat familiar. I ordered what I thought would be a simple chicken enchilada. It was a mole sauce, which I had never tried before. Not a fan. I had just a couple bites. This \"mexican bitter chocolate\" sauce had no place on food at all, but I've heard a lot of great things about it, so maybe it's just my personal taste. My friend's pulled pork was delicious, had a couple bites of that. I've obviously realized by now that this is Mexico City type food and not traditional \"beans and rice, chips and salsa\" type food. The meal was served with a side of very soggy vegetables-again, not typical vegetables that you would even want to eat, so I didn't understand that either.Is this a side? Is it a garnish? Is this creative? What the F I am hungry!! I had a bite of what I think was zuchini. It was almost like they were soaked in oil and steamed. I would have loved to have spotted and better yet tasted anywhere in anything we ordered some cilantro, some green onion, but no such luck! Again, I realize that a lot of people probably love this restaurant. Just putting my review out there to help those who have not been be aware of what kind of experience they might have. I would never go there again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0.9990686062128968|3.226014688922315E-4 |2.948515699424973E-4 |3.139407482685612E-4 |\n",

The woman at the counter was arguing with one of the cooks and seemed annoyed with me, as she asked me \"what you want\" at least four times. I ordered the vegetable and tofu soup in vegetable broth. The food was prepared almost frighteningly fast, but being as hungry as I was, this didn't bother me very much.\n",

The rice noodles were tender and delicious, and the cook on the vegetables was quite well done, too (not too soft and mushy). The tofu were chunky and most likely deep fried pieces, but soaked up the broth quite heartily.\n",

I don't want to confirm this because I am quite accustomed to eating mostly low salt/salt free, but it did seem very sodium and MSG laden. I also didn't taste any significant seasoning in the broth besides salt, so it's quite possible that I was eating salty hot water with noodles. Hmm.\n",

There are so many better places in the area for Asian food (although I'm not sure specifically about Vietnamese food) and they have surprisingly few options for pho which was disappointing. Will probably not return and opt for miso and tofu soup nearby at one of the many Japanese establishments near by.
